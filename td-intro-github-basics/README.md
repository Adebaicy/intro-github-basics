My understanding on git:
I understand git to be a version-control system with the capacity to take note of changes while working on files on one's computer

Definition of version control:
It can also be called source control. It engages tracking and managing changes to software code.
It entail tools that help software teams manage changes to a source code over out.

Process to commit a project to git:
-Initialize the project folder using 'git init' at the top most root.
-Make the files recognized by git via 'git add .'
-followed by committing the files with a message attached via 'git commit -m "message" '
-make the online repo aware that you want to a certain folder to it via " git remote add origin _repo-link_
-"git push" it to the online repo.
